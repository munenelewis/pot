            <img src="http://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Gary-Vaynerchuk.png" alt=""> </br>
            Gary is the smartest and most hard-working guy in the marketing and entrepreneur world. I read one of his amazing books: “Jab, jab, jab, right hook”, which can be perceived as “Give, give, give and ask”. In marketing or any aspect in life, before asking
            for something, you have to give value to people without 0 expectation. That’s one of the main reasons I started my Youtube channel to teach people how to create web applications. I still keep this lesson in my heart till this day.

            If you have read his book or a fan of Gary, DM me now and you’ll be my friend.

            Casey Neistat is the best story teller on Youtube. His stories resonate with the audience. He ignites my curiousity in how to build a product that is as engaging as his videos.

            <button class="center" type="button">That sounds amazing!</button>

            My life mission right now is to somehow bring creativity into the web platform and to create engaging and interesting websites that visitors love to come back. </br>
